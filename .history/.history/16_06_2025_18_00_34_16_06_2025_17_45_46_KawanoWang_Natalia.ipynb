    "##### Understanding user engagement in online platforms such as video games is critical for developers and researchers. In this project, I analyze data from a Minecraft research server to determine if using players' **age** and **hours played** can be a reliable way to predict whether they subscribe to a game-related newsletter.The aim of this project is to help a research group at UBC target their recruitment efforts #####\n",
